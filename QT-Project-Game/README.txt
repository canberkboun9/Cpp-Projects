I have done the homework in QtCreator with Qt 5.14.2 as stated in the QT PS.
I wrote all the code in QtCreator. All the .cpp, .h files and .pro files are 
in the directory named Project3. 
Instructions to open the program:
open QtCreator, in the welcome section click Open, choose the Project3 directory,
then choose .pro file and open.
